backend together, and easily deploy them to Heroku.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v14 or higher), and npm
- Heroku CLI

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.

Then run:

```

You can use the following commands to run the application:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- `rails start`: run the frontend and backend together with one command
